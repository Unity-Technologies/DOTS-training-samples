# Tips and Troubleshooting

## What statistics are available?

* **Min**
    * Min is short for minimum and represents the lowest value for the marker or frame time.
* **Max**
    * Max is short for maximum and represents the largest value for the marker or frame time.
* [Median](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median)
    * Median can be thought of as the *middle* value of a data set, it is the value separating the higher half from the lower half of a data set. 
* [Mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean)
    * Mean is the *average* value in a data set, it is the sum of all the values in the data set divided by the number of values in the data set.
* [Lower and Upper Quartiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile)
    * The lower quartile is defined as the middle number between the smallest number and the median of the data set. The upper quartile is the middle value between the median and the highest value of the data set.
* [Interquartile Range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range)
    * The *interquartile range* is a measure of statistical dispersion, being equal to the difference between 75th and 25th percentiles, or between the upper and lower quartiles.


### How are the statistics represented?

We show the above statistics in a number of ways, in columns of data in the *frame*, *thread* and *marker* summaries as part of the *Single* and *Compare* views, along with [histogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram) and [box and whisker plots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot) giving a visual representation of the distribution of time.

To help understand how to read these graphs take a look at our [distribution graph](distributions.md) explanation.
